# BigDataProject
Tobacco use is a serious issue and users are typically uninformed thus targeted by tobacco companies. The hypothesis of this project is that there will be a correlation between tobacco use, high child poverty rates, and lower education levels in each state. This is a video explaining this collaborative project:

# Program Purpose and Development
The main program, BigData, uses the classes Education, Income, and TobaccoUse to condense the datasets “Education.csv”, “Income.csv”, and “YouthTobaccoUse.csv”. The purpose of the program is to use each of the three datasets to provide a certain facet of the final data needed to form our hypothesis. The Education.java class uses the “Education.csv” file to derive the levels of education received in each state. The Income.java class uses the “Income.csv” dataset to find the average number and percentage of children in each state that is poor. The Tobacco.java class uses the “YouthTobaccoUse.csv” dataset to find the average percentage of tobacco in all forms (smoked and unsmoked) actively by youth in each state. The data was then parsed and merged and combined into one final dataset called “BigData.csv” that was then used to create a graph that confirmed our hypothesis that in greater areas of poverty and lower levels of education, there is a greater amount of tobacco use among youth.
